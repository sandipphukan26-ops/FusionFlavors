# 🚨 URGENT: Supabase Setup Required

## ❌ CRITICAL ERROR: "Invalid login credentials"

**STATUS: Authentication is currently BROKEN**

The "Invalid login credentials" error happens because Supabase has email confirmation enabled by default. **You MUST disable this immediately for the app to work.**

## ⚠️ REQUIRED STEP: Disable Email Confirmation

**🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Follow these steps EXACTLY:**

1. **🌐 Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/khdqwwzgxwwuyntphuoi
2. **📂 Navigate to**: **Authentication** → **Settings**
3. **🔍 Find**: "Email Confirmation" section (scroll down if needed)
4. **❌ Toggle OFF**: "Enable email confirmations" 
5. **💾 Click "Save"** at the bottom of the page
6. **✅ Verify**: The toggle should now be OFF/disabled

## ✅ Expected Result After Fix:

- ✅ Users can sign in **immediately** after creating accounts
- ✅ No email confirmation required  
- ✅ The "Invalid login credentials" error will be **RESOLVED**
- ✅ Authentication will work normally

## 🔄 Test After Fix:

1. **Create a new account** in the app
2. **Sign in immediately** with the same credentials  
3. **Should work without errors**

## 📊 Current Status Check:

- ❌ **Email confirmation**: ENABLED (causing errors)
- ❌ **User sign-in**: BROKEN  
- ❌ **App functionality**: LIMITED

**🎯 Goal**: Get email confirmation DISABLED so authentication works

## 🔧 Alternative: Enable Email Service (Advanced)

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled (NOT recommended for development):

1. **Configure SMTP**: Authentication → Settings → SMTP Settings
2. **Add email service**: Gmail, SendGrid, etc.
3. **Test email flow**: Users must confirm emails before sign-in

**⚠️ Recommendation**: Disable email confirmation for now to get the app working, then set up email service later if needed.
